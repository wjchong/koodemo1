Hi Woi joon,  
  
How are you?  
  
I noticed you requested a demo with MoEngage. I work with companies in your
area, and my goal is to be helpful during your evaluation process.  
Our demos are two parts. The first is a conversation focused around helping me
to understand what you're hoping we can help with, as well as your strategy
and goals in general, so then I can customize your demo accordingly.  
To get started, do let me know when can we have a quick 10 minutes call around
the same.  
Looking forward to connecting.  
  
If you don't want to hear from me again, please [let me know](http://infinite-
stream-5194.herokuapp.com/optout?m=mmm_EOoEL9&email=wjchong@koofamilies.com).![](http
