Hey Wjchong,  
  
Hope this email finds you well!  
  
Following up on my last email in regards to the product demo you requested.  
  
Prior to the demo, would request if we can connect for a quick 15 min call
sometime this week, we would like to understand your current user engagement
and retention strategy in details and ways MoEngage can help.  
  
Let me know your availability.  
  
If you don't want to hear from me again, please [let me know](http://infinite-
stream-5194.herokuapp.com/optout?m=mmm_xyQ425&email=wjchong@koofamilies.com).

Hi Woi joon,  
  
How are you?  
  
I noticed you requested a demo with MoEngage. I work with companies in your
area, and my goal is to be helpful during your evaluation process.  
Our demos are two parts. The first is a conversation focused around helping me
to understand what you're hoping we can help with, as well as your strategy
and goals in general, so then I can customize your demo accordingly.  
To get started, do let me know when can we have a quick 10 minutes call around
the same.  
Looking forward to connecting.  
  
If you don't want to hear from me again, please [let me know](http://infinite-
stream-5194.herokuapp.com/optout?m=mmm_EOoEL9&email=wjchong@koofamilies.com).
